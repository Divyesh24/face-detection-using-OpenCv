# face-detection-using-OpenCv

The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object with label.

## OpenCV

-OpenCV is the most popular library for computer vision. Originally written in C/C++, it now provides bindings for Python.
-OpenCV uses cascades
-The cascades themselves are just a bunch of XML files that contain OpenCV data used to detect objects. You initialize your code with the cascade you want, and then it does the work for you
-Since face detection is such a common case, OpenCV comes with a number of built-in cascades for detecting everything from faces to eyes to hands to legs.

Steps for implementation :
 -Install requirements<br>
 -click your picture from various angles with good quality.<br>
 -put those pictures into a folder named your-name.
 -then run faces-train.py python file (it is faster)
 -after that run faces.py  
 -Now the webcam will be opened and it will detect your face with the label.
